## by (Okwechime Dennis)


## Dataset

- This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area , the dataset consists of 183,412 rows and 16 columns. the columns are namely ( duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_is, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip)

## Summary of Findings

 The majority of riders, I found, tended to ride their bikes for between 300 and 2000 seconds on average, which makes sense given how taxing it can be to ride a bike for long periods of time.
Additionally, it was discovered that the platform experienced high activity daily between the hours of 7-8 AM and 5-8 PM, with typical rider usage rising from Monday through Thursday before reaching weekly lows on Saturday and Sunday, supporting the idea that the platform is typically used by workers travelling to and from their place of employment.

## Key Insights for Presentation

This report aims to illustrate the weekdays and times of day when customers used the bike platform to determine when the majority of journeys were made. This report also intends to demonstrate the connection between the times when journeys are taken and the types of clients, such as platform members or infrequent consumers.
